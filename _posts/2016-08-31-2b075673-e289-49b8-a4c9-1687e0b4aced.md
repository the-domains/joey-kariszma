Why is it that we often see the negative of a situation before we start searching for the possible positives? Is it just me? Am I broken?

it turns out that this is the survival instinct at work. The lizard brain, or "Squirm" like I call mine, saving our lives from the sabre toothed tiger in the dark. 

You see, the lizard brain, reptilian brain or amygdala, gets it's name because it's the oldest part of our nervous system. Our fight or flight response comes from there, hence survival instinct.
