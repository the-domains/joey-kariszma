## How to tap yourself into a healthier and powerful mindset.

The art of tapping has it's origins in Chinese medecine. It is linked to the energetic body by specific acupressure points to lesser or abolish emotional imprints on oneself. One starts by connecting with the undesired feeling, thought or mindset and defining where it is and how it manifests in the body. 

Example : "I feel that my headache is a red pulsing jagged rock that is throwing itself on the inner walls of my skull."

Then, rate that pain/thought/emotion from 0 to 10\. 0 being no impact whatsoever and 10 being awful and all encompassing. 

Now comes the tapping portion where you use your hand (either is fine) to lightly tap specific areas on the body. By tapping with larger zones (2-3 fingers) it becomes fairly forgiving in the exact area required to tap on. I will detail them here and link to a video that shows me doing it with my fear of  succeeding. 

* top of the head
* middle of the eyebrows (third eye)
* side of the eye (either side) on the bone
* beneath same eye on the top of the cheekbone
* junction of collar bones and top ribs (hand in a "V" shape)
* squeeze either wrist 
* breathe in and exhale out fully
* "Peace" or any other word that seems appropriate to you, "Release", "Free", "Freedom", "Safe", insert your creativity here.
